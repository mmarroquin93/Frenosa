However, lots of people are understandably worried about getting ripped off—mechanics are pretty good at detecting when a customer doesn&#8217;t know anything about cars. To avoid this, it&#8217;s a good idea to narrow down the possibilities of what&#8217;s going on inside your car.</p>
<p>The warning lights on your dashboard are the most obvious starting point. Yet the most common, the Check Engine light, can be utterly confusing because it can cover problems ranging widely in severity. Others, like the engine temperature light, tire pressure light, or oil light are more straightforward to decipher. Regardless of what lights up, never ignore it. Delaying a diagnosis and repair could lead to even bigger problems down the road.</p></blockquote>
